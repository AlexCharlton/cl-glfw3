# cl-glfw3
Bindings for the GLFW library, version 3.x, for Common Lisp. These bindings have been enhanced with several conveniences, as described in `cl-glfw3.lisp`.

Direct bindings to all GLFW functions can be found in the package `%glfw` (`glfw-bindings.lisp`).

At the moment these bindings are largely untested, aside from what can be seen in the examples directory. Contributions are most welcome!

The best place to find documentation for GLFW3 is [their official site](http://www.glfw.org/docs/3.0/index.html).
